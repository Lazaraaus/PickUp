Just some initial things I thought of about database schema.

-SW

Tables:
	Locations
	Sports
	Players
	Current Games
	Past Games
	Accounts

Locations
	Location Name
	Latitude
	Longitude

Sports
	Location Name
	Sport
	Max # of concurrent games

Players
	GameID
	PlayerID
	//GameID + PlayerID combo must be unique
//Create a current Players and Past Players tables?

Current Games
	GameID
	Location Name
	Sport
	# of players
	Date
	Start Time
	End Time
	Notes

Past Games
	GameID
	Location Name
	Sport
	# of players
	Date
	Start Time
	End Time
	Notes

//Is it uesful to split Games into 2 tables?

Accounts
	PlayerID
	Favorite Sport
	Favorite Person
